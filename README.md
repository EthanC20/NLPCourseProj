# OpenBG500 Link Prediction

HITsz NLP course project

advisor: Ruifeng Xu

This course project is my attempt to get started with graph neural networks. The benchmark test is based on the transE model. Hope that through the project, we can see the improvement of graph neural networks in link prediction tasks compared to the Trans model.
